# Getting And Cleaning Data Week 4 Project

This is the README for the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The code in  run_analysis.R performs the following functions:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
The end results should be shown in tidt.txt
